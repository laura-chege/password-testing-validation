# password-testing-validation
Write a script to check and validate passwords. The object is to flag "weak" or easily guessed password candidates. A trial password will be input to the script as a command-line parameter. To be  considered acceptable, a password must meet the following minimum qualifications: • Minimum length of 8 characters • Must contain at least one numeric character • Must contain at least one of the following non-alphabetic  characters: @, #, $, %, &amp;, *, +, -, = Optional: • Do a dictionary check on every sequence of at least four consecutive alphabetic  characters in the password under test. This will eliminate passwords containing  embedded "words" found in a standard dictionary.
